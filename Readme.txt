Abstract:
In this project, I designed the 50Hz notch filter by modifying 30Hz low-pass filter to 
decrease the order. The instrument achieves the goal of enhancement and filtering of 
signals on embedded system. Since the weight of whole instrument is lighter than 30g,
it provides a new idea for miniaturization of notch filter.

Files list:
50hz_notch_filter.c:		Main function to control ADuC7026. This code 
				needs to be run in Keil uvision together with
				ADuC7026 library.
